    "post_content": "🚴‍♂️“Cycling is dead.” Remember that take?\n\nFor the past several years, the industry narrative went something like this:\n\nBoutiques killed it → Home bikes finished it off → Members got bored → Group cycling is dead.\n\nExcept… Bay Club didn’t get the memo.\n\nThey quadrupled group cycle attendance by doing something radical.\n\nThey stopped treating cycling like a commodity and rebuilt it as an experience.\n\nHere's what actually changed 👇\n🔥 They made it feel electric again\n Lights, sound, pacing, energy. This wasn’t “rows of bikes in a bright room.” It was an event.\n🎯 They programmed for humans, not schedules\n Clear class identities. Consistency. Zero guesswork about what you’re signing up for.\n🎤 They elevated instructors from “bike counters” to performers\n\nCoaching clarity, connection, and presence. People came back for who was leading, not just what the workout was.\n📣 They marketed it like it mattered\n If it looks optional, it gets treated as optional. They made cycling unmissable.\n🧠 They removed intimidation and friction\n New riders felt welcome. Regulars felt challenged. Nobody felt lost.\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable truth:\n 👉 Cycling didn’t die. Lazy execution did.\nWhen the experience is intentional, proven formats are supported, and instructors are set up to win, members vote with their feet.\n\n So let’s be honest. Is cycling “dead” in your club…or just under-designed?\n(🔥 forward this to the person who wrote it off in 2019)\n\nFull case study in the comments 👇"
